# Computer-Networks--Sliding-Window-Protocol

This repository is based on a Computer Networks Project on a sliding window protocol named Go-Back-N protocol.


Go-Back-N protocol, also called Go-Back-N Automatic Repeat Request, is a data link layer protocol that uses a sliding window method for reliable and sequential delivery of data frames.

Go back means the sender has to go back to N places from the last transmitted packet in the unacknowledged window and not from the point where the packet is lost.
It uses the principle of protocol pipelining in which multiple frames can be sent before receiving the acknowledgment of the first frame.
